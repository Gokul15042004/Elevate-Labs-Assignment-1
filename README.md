The concepts that I have used to build the calculator is:
1. Methods such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide().
2. Scanner class - to get input from the user that perform the operations.
3. Loops - I have used while loop to repeat the operations.
4. Switch case - I have used switch case to perform the actions which the user provides.
5. Condition - Used if-else to check the conditions that the user provides.
